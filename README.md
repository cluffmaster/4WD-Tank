# 4WD-Tank / Poor Mans RC-XD

# I am new to Github so please be patient with my layouts etc.

# This Build is for my 4WD Raspberry Pi controlled tank with Firework Launcher on its Back

# Using an LS98N Motor driver Board and a 4 port relay board to launch the firework via an e match

# Driving the robot is currently done via the keyboard using curses to trigger the movement with the arrow keys, and also to fire the E-Matches using F, G, H, J keys for each Rocket / firework.
